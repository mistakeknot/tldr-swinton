# Plan: Bump Plugin to v0.7.2

## Bead: 993 — Bump plugin to v0.7.1 (re-scoped to v0.7.2)

> Note: v0.7.1 was already committed (521c53c) but the plugin commands weren't
> updated. Since then, uncommitted changes added an MCP server. We'll bump to
> v0.7.2 to capture both the command updates AND the MCP server addition.

## Changes

### 1. Update `/tldrs-context` command (`commands/context.md`)
- Add `--delegate` argument (task description string)
- Brief tip about delegation use case

### 2. Update `/tldrs-diff` command (`commands/diff-context.md`)
- Add `--no-verify` / `--verify` arguments
- Brief tip about coherence verification

### 3. Bump version to 0.7.2
- `pyproject.toml`
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- `../interagency-marketplace/.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`

### 4. Commit the MCP server addition + command updates + version bump

## Out of scope
- New skills (the existing skills already guide Claude to use the right flags)
- MCP server tool additions (already done in uncommitted changes)
