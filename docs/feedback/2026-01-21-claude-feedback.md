# Claude Feedback - tldr-swinton
**Date:** 2026-01-21
**Context:** Portfolio review for Anthropic job application visibility

---

## Strategic Assessment

### Why This Project Matters
tldr-swinton solves a **real LLM pain point** - token efficiency. Your benchmarks (48-95% savings) are impressive and measurable.

- Technical credibility: AST parsing, semantic search, FAISS embeddings
- Research-adjacent: The kind of tooling Anthropic engineers would appreciate
- Measurable impact: Hard numbers on token savings

### Twitter-Friendly Angle
> "LLMs waste tokens reading entire files. I built a semantic code search that gives 93% token savings by only surfacing relevant symbols. Here's the 5-layer analysis architecture..."

---

## Gaps Identified

### Obvious Gaps
1. **No web playground** - CLI only, no way to "try it" without installing
2. **Benchmarks not published/visualized** - Numbers exist but not presented as a proper eval
3. **No blog post** explaining the architecture

### Non-Obvious Gaps
1. **No "research-y" artifact** - Turn benchmarks into a paper-style writeup with methodology
2. **Underutilized Claude Code integration** - tldrs plugin exists (v0.1.0) but not showcased
3. **No comparison to alternatives** - How does it compare to raw files, tree-sitter alone, CodeGrok?

## Recommended Open Source Integrations

### High Priority: Better Embeddings

**[Nomic Embed Code](https://huggingface.co/nomic-ai/nomic-embed-code)** - State-of-the-art code embeddings
- Better than sentence-transformers for code
- Designed specifically for code retrieval
- Could improve semantic search quality significantly

Current: sentence-transformers (general purpose)
Upgrade: Nomic Embed Code (code-specific, SOTA)

**Impact:** Your 84.8% semantic search token savings could improve to 90%+

### Medium Priority: Faster Vector Store

**[LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/)** - Faster than FAISS
- Written in Rust, very fast
- Embedded (no server needed)
- Better for incremental updates
- Native support for filtering

### Medium Priority: Eval Framework

**[Braintrust](https://github.com/braintrustdata/braintrust)** - LLM evals
- Build proper benchmarks with visualizations
- Track improvements over time
- Makes token efficiency claims more credible

**[Promptfoo](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo)** - If you add LLM-based features
- Systematic prompt testing
- Regression detection

### Low Priority: Study These

**[CodeGrok MCP](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/code-context)** - Similar tool, MCP-native
- 10x context efficiency claims
- AST + embeddings like you
- Study their approach, differentiate yours

**[Code Context](https://milvus.io/blog/build-open-source-alternative-to-cursor-with-code-context.md)** - Open source Cursor alternative
- Uses Tree-sitter + embeddings
- Good reference architecture

## Action Items

### This Week (High Impact, Low Effort)
- [ ] Swap sentence-transformers for Nomic Embed Code (drop-in)
- [ ] Re-run benchmarks with new embeddings
- [ ] Create visualization of token savings (bar chart)
- [ ] Add comparison table: tldrs vs raw files vs tree-sitter-only

### This Month (High Impact, Medium Effort)
- [ ] Write blog post: "5-Layer Code Analysis for Token Efficiency"
- [ ] Publish benchmarks as GitHub Pages eval site
- [ ] Create demo GIF showing semantic search in action
- [ ] Promote tldrs Claude Code plugin integration

### Future (Nice to Have)
- [ ] Web playground (simple Vercel deployment)
- [ ] LanceDB migration for faster incremental updates
- [ ] Paper-style writeup with methodology section
- [ ] Comparison benchmark against CodeGrok
